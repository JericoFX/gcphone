###### GCPHONE  JERICOFX#3512

if you think that my time deserve a coffe

# buymeacoff.ee/jericofx

Take from the original resource and modified to work with Qbus based servers.


------------

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION

I found a fix to the Nil values in the server console, it happend because when we are in the selection menu, the resource want an id, at that momento we dont have that, so the fix i found is going to the rs-spawn (qb-spawn) in this part https://prnt.sc/wdv3av  put the trigger event in this case is  TriggerEvent('gcphone:FixOnLoad)  like the image.

To install this resource you need:

if you use a Custom based QBCore like me just change FXCore to .........

MenuV from Tigo https://github.com/ThymonA/menuv (No need yet)

Run the SQL code.

The Resource name MUST BE gcphone

start the dependences like Screenshot-basic first

Change in the config.lua the discord WEBHOOK << # IF YOU DONT CHANGE THIS THE PICTURE FAIL AND CRASH
